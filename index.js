//----------------Variable Declaration and Boolean Expressions

//1 - Declare Variables
//Declare two variables, firstName and lastName, and assign them your first and last name as string values.
let firstName = "John";
let lastName = "Kilinski";
//Declare a variable age and assign it your age as a number.
let age = ;
//Declare a variable isStudent and assign it a boolean value (true if you are a student, false otherwise).
let isStudent = true;

//2 - Boolean Expressions
//Write a boolean expression to check if age is greater than 18. Assign the result to a variable isAdult.
let isAgeGreaterThan18 = age >= 18
if (isAgeGreaterThan18) console.log("You're an adult")
else console.log("You're a teenager")
//Write a boolean expression to check if firstName is equal to "John". Assign the result to a variable isJohn.
let isFirstName = firstName === "John";
if (isFirstName) console.log("Hello John"); else console.log("You're not John")


//--------------------------Functions and String Methods
// Write a Function:
//Write a function named greet that takes two parameters, firstName and lastName.
//Inside the function, create a variable fullName that concatenates firstName and lastName with a space in between.
//Return a greeting message that says, "Hello, fullName! Welcome to the IITC Bootcamp."
//String Methods:
//Inside the greet function, convert the fullName to uppercase before returning the greeting message.let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
let fullName = firstName + lastName
function greet(firstName, lastName) {
    console.log(`Hello ${fullName.toLocaleUpperCase()}! Welcome to the IITC Bootcamp`)
}
greet()

//----------------------------Conditions
//If and Else:
//Write a function named checkAge that takes one parameter, age.
//Inside the function, use an if-else statement to check:
//If age is less than 13, return "You are a child."
//If age is between 13 and 17 (inclusive), return "You are a teenager."
//If age is between 18 and 64 (inclusive), return "You are an adult."
//If age is 65 or older, return "You are a senior."

function checkAge(age) {
    if (age < 13) return "You are a child"
    else if (age >= 13 && age <= 17) return "You are a teenager"
    else if (age >= 18 && age <= 64) return "You are an adult"
    else return "You are a senior"
}
console.log(checkAge(age))

// Switch Statement:
// Write a function named getDayMessage that takes one parameter, dayOfWeek.
// Inside the function, use a switch statement to return a message for each day of the week (Monday to Sunday).
// Example: If dayOfWeek is "Monday", return "Start of the work week!"
// If dayOfWeek is not recognized, return "Invalid day!"

let dayOfWeek = "hello";
function getDayMessage(dayOfWeek) {
    switch (dayOfWeek) {
        case "sunday": return `Today is ${dayOfWeek}`;
        case "monday": return `Today is ${dayOfWeek}`;
        case "tuesday": return `Today is ${dayOfWeek}`;
        case "weensday": return `Today is ${dayOfWeek}`;
        case "thursday": return `Today is ${dayOfWeek}`;
        case "friday": return `Today is ${dayOfWeek}`;
        case "saturday": return `Today is ${dayOfWeek}`;
        default: return "Dia invÃ¡lido"
    }
}
console.log(getDayMessage(dayOfWeek))

// Complex Conditions:
// Write a function named checkEligibility that takes two parameters, age and isStudent.
// Inside the function, use a series of if-else statements to check the following:
// -If age is less than 18 and isStudent is true, return "You are a minor student."
// -If age is less than 18 and isStudent is false, return "You are a minor non-student."
// -If age is between 18 and 24 and isStudent is true, return "You are a young adult student."
// -If age is between 18 and 24 and isStudent is false, return "You are a young adult non-student."
// If age is 25 or older and isStudent is true, return "You are an adult student."
// If age is 25 or older and isStudent is false, return "You are an adult non-student."

function checkElegibility(age, isStudent) {
    if (age < 18 && isStudent) return "You are a minor student."
    else if (age < 18 && !isStudent) return "You are a minor non-student."
    else if (age >= 18 && age <= 24 && isStudent) return "You are a young adult student."
    else if (age >= 18 && age <= 24 && !isStudent) return "You are a young adult non-student."
    else if (age >= 25 && isStudent) return "You are an adult student."
    else return "You are an adult non-student."
}
console.log(checkElegibility(age, isStudent))

//------------------- String Comparison and Manipulation:
// Write a function named formatName that takes one parameter, name.
// Inside the function, use trim() to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the name.
// Use toLowerCase() to convert the name to lowercase.
// Check if the formatted name is equal to "admin":
// If true, return "Welcome, Admin!"
// Else, return "Hello, name!"

let userName = "              admin"
function formatName(name) {
    //console.log(name.trim())
    if (userName.trim() === "admin") return "Welcome, admin!"
    else return `Hello, ${userName.trim()}!`
}
console.log(formatName(userName))

// ------------------Nested If Statements:
// Write a function named checkDiscount that takes two parameters, age and isMember.
// Inside the function, use nested if statements to determine the discount:
// If age is less than 18:
// If isMember is true, return "You get a 20% discount."
// Else, return "You get a 10% discount."
// If age is 65 or older:
// If isMember is true, return "You get a 30% discount."
// Else, return "You get a 20% discount."
// If age is between 18 and 64:
// If isMember is true, return "You get a 10% discount."
// Else, return "No discount available."

let isMember = false
function checkDiscount(age, isMember) {
    if (age<18){
        if(isMember) return "You get a 20% discount"
        else return "You get a 10% discount"
    }
    if (age>=65){
        if(isMember) return "You get a 30% discount"
        else return "You get a 20% discount"
    }
    if (18<= age <=64){
        if(isMember) return "You get a 10% discount"
        else return "No discount available"
    }
}
console.log(checkDiscount(age, isMember))

// Login Validation:
// Write a function named validateLogin that takes two parameters, username and password.
// Inside the function, create a variable storedUsername and assign it a string value representing the correct username.
// Create a variable storedPassword and assign it a string value representing the correct password.
// Use an if-else statement to check:
// If username is equal to storedUsername and password is equal to storedPassword, return "Login successful."
// Else, return "Invalid username or password."
